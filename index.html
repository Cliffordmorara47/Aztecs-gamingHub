        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We are a online working platform based on connecting developers who develop gaming apps with the current developing market.
            The Aztecs gamingHub began back in 2010. The programme began with only 800 subscribers but currently, over 5 billion users 
            are using our websites to download game apps. Join and subscribe to our platform to get updates on new apps and the most 
            rated apps.
            To clarify, games don't need to have been released within the calendar year to qualify for this roundup. Any game that's still available and still considered excellent when ranked against the best of today is eligible. We think that's the most useful approach to helping you decide which video games deserve space on your PC's hard drive, and which aren't worth consideration even when their prices are cut by 85 percent during a Steam sale.
